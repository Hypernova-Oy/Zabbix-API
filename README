Zabbix::API

* About Zabbix::API

Zabbix is a free software monitoring solution.  This distribution is an
abstraction layer over the JSON-RPC API provided by Zabbix, allowing you to log
in, create, update, delete, and generally manipulate many (but as of yet not
all) types of objects, all in Perl with Perlish constructs.

Examples are available in the examples/ folder; the tests are also good material
to start with.

* About us

This distribution was originally written by Uperto for SFR, a French ISP and
telecom.

* Bugs and complaints

We have the usual RT queue on rt.cpan.org.
